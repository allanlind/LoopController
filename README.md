# LoopController
Magnetic Loop Controller based on design by Loftur
This is the smallest possible footprint for the Magnetic Loop Controller which make possible the use in portable situations.
The project consists of 2 printed circuit boards 77 x 56.5mm. One board holds all components including 4x20 LCD character display and Teensy 3.2/4.0 and DRV8825 stepper motor driver.
